# Unit Converter

Creates a conversion app using the Android Studio project. It is based on following aspects:
- 1 input field (EditText)
- 1 output field (TextView)
- Spinners to select the conversion
- An appropriate layout
 * Uses a constraint layout as a main xml layout.
 * Constraint layout contains 3 linear layouts embedded in it.
 * These linear layout has palettes like TextViews, Spinners, EditText, and ImageView

- So far efficient to make conversion on length units such as:
 * Miles
 * Kilometer
 * Meter
 * Centimeter
 * Millimeter
 * Yards
 * Feet

- No restrictions or limitations on conversion for above mentioned units.  
- Values can be converted to and fro from above available units according to the user need.
